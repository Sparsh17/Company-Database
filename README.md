# Company-Database
 
We need to create a database schema design based on the following (simplified) requirements of the COMPANY Database:


1. The company is organized into branches. Each branch has a name, unique ID and an employee who manages the branch. We keep track of the branch supplier by storing the records of the supplier name and the supply type. A branch may have several branch suppliers.
2. Each branch handles a number of clients.

3. We store each employeeâ€™s ID number, address, salary, sex, and birthdate.

4. Each employee works for one branch but may work with several clients.
5. One employee manages one branch. We keep a track of the start time of management for the employee for a branch.
6. We also keep track of the directed supervisor of each employee and the supervisee associated with each employee.
7. An employee may work with a number of clients.
8. For each client, we keep track of their name, unique ID, relationship to the employee.
